# Git Commits

## Message Style

Use the following commit message template:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<description>
```

- The <type> can be: agents, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, test,
  tool.
- The <scope> can be a project, package, or app name; omit the scope and its
  wrapped parens if none is clear.
- The <subject> and <description> should explain the motivations and changes.
- Include a description body for every commit unless the staged change is truly
  mechanical or trivial and the subject fully explains it.
- Keep every commit message line 72 characters or fewer. Hard-wrap body text to
  72 columns before committing; do not leave long single-line descriptions.
- Use imperative mood; be concise
- Include user-provided context when it improves the message
- Do not include AI attribution in or after the description

## Commit Boundaries

Each commit should be independently understandable and shippable.

- Split unrelated behavior, package areas, generated artifacts, and dependency
  bumps into separate commits.
- For larger implementations, commit in vertical slices: tests or fixtures,
  implementation, docs/examples, and follow-up polish can be separate only when
  each commit still makes sense on its own.
- Do not mix mechanical formatting with behavioral changes unless the formatter
  only touched the files required for that change.
- Do not include local artifacts from `.agents/ignore/`, `.context/`, logs,
  build outputs, or editor files.
- Before committing, inspect staged changes with `git diff --cached` and make
  sure every staged file belongs to the commit's stated purpose.

If two changes would need different test commands or different reviewers, they
usually deserve different commits.

## Verification Before Each Commit

Every commit should be verified before it is created.

If the full baseline fails for unrelated pre-existing issues, say that in the
commit handoff and include the first relevant failure. Do not describe the
commit as fully verified unless the required commands actually passed.

## Creating Commits

Use non-interactive commands where possible:

```bash
git status --short
git diff -- <paths>
git add <paths>
git diff --cached
git commit -m "<message>"
```

Include a wrapped commit body for ordinary source changes:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'COMMIT'
fix(template): Keep generated output stable

Keep generated output stable when inputs are normalized so repeated runs do not
produce noisy changes.
COMMIT
```

Use a subject-only commit only for changes where no useful description exists,
such as a typo fix or a purely mechanical formatting commit.
