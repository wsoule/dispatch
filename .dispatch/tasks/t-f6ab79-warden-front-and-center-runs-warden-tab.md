## Description

Wyat 2026-08-11: "warden needs to be more front and center. it needs to be in the right sidebar. needs a tab toggle at the top to go between the runs and warden."

Give the right rail (LiveRail) a two-tab header: **Runs** (the current live-agents list + attention strip, unchanged) and **Warden** (the warden chat, compact). The warden tab reuses the conversation machinery behind WardenView (useWardenSession, the transcript/composer/pending-action confirm cards) reshaped for a ~15rem column — message list + composer + confirm cards stacked, no side-by-side layout. The full WardenView page stays; the rail tab is the always-available entry point.

Constraints:
- Active tab persisted per device (localStorage, alongside the rail's collapsed state key dispatch:live-rail).
- The attention strip ("N waiting on you →") stays visible on BOTH tabs — it is the rail's one always-on signal.
- The collapsed rail keeps working as today; expanding returns to the last active tab.
- Pending warden action confirms must remain human-gated exactly as in WardenView — same confirm component, no shortcut paths.
- A live warden turn in progress should show on the Runs tab too (the warden is an agent; it belongs in the agent list with kind label 'warden'), clicking it switches to the Warden tab.
- Component tests for tab switching, persistence, and the confirm card rendering in the rail; reuse WardenView's existing test seams (fake backend) rather than new mocks.
